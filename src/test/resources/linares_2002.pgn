{ This game pairs the two finalists of the FIDE world championship. Ponomariov won that match. This could be seen as a continuation, if one desired; though that's not really productive. }
1. e4
{ Ponomariov plays 1. e4 in much the same way as any of the other top-level GMs. }
1...e6
{ Now, along with Pe4 there is an indication Black will place pawns on light-color squares to prevent Bf1 from ever being dangerous. White will probably have to meet 2...d5 with e4-e5 to open the d3-h7 diagonal. So, White needs a Pd4 to support Pe5. }
2. d4 d5 3. Nc3
{ I've had doubts about this move for a long time. It's not so easy to prove it's wrong, but by blocking Pc2 it makes d3 less hospitable for a bishop and it makes Pd4 a little weaker. }
 ( 3. e5 
{ favored by Nimcovics (at least in commentaries) and leaves open the way for c2-c3, so Bf1-d3 can't be chased off the d3-h7 diagonal by ...c7-c5-c4. However, This variation offers Black a natural point of attack (Pd4) and that allows him to keep the balance. }
 ) ( 3. Nd2 
{ aims to support Pe4, so White might still have use of central squares. But, this also fails to pressure Black in any substantial way and so offers only a slight advantage. }
 ) ( 3. exd5 
{ opens lines in hopes of catching Ke8 on the open e-file, but in practice doesn't generally cause many problems. Black can develop his pieces freely. }
 ) 3...Bb4 $1
{ Winawer Variation -- by pinning Nc3 Black keeps Nc3 awkward. It does, however, give White time for e4-e5. }
 ( 3...dxe4 
{ prevents e4-e5, but releases Nc3, so it's not to be recommended for all occasions. It will be seen in several games later in this tournament. }
 ) 4. e5 c5
{ Black attacks in a most natural way, though he does leave Pg7 exposed for the moment. }
 ( 
{ an interesting alternative way to defend Pg7 is }
 4...Qd7 5. Qg4 f5 6. Qg3 b6 
{ when Black plans ...Bc8-a6xf1 to trade off his bad bishop and clearing the way for further developments; while leaving open options for Ke8. It changes the king-side pawn structure before White can impress his will there. The downside is that it weakens Pe6 and brings Pf5 closer to White, so a move such as g2-g4 is closer to forcing a line-opening. }
 ) ( 
{ Another idea, similar to ...Qd8-d7 is }
 4...b6 5. a3 Bf8 
{ where Black believes he has fixed Pd4 on a weak square and he isn't about to trade ...Bb4xNc3 until forced. The downside is that Nc3 is now free to move, freeing up c2-c3 and ensuring Bf1-d3 will be comfortable. There's also a chance White might use Pa3 to support b2-b4 in an effort to clamp down on Black's queen-side "break" ...c7-c5. }
 ) 5. a3
{ This is a saving grace which helps White straighten-out his queen-side a bit. }
5...Bxc3+ ( 5...Ba5 
{ has been tried, to keep the pressure on, but it hasn't proven to be more effective than the game move }
 ) 6. bxc3
{ After this it's clear White has to attack at the base of Black's pawn chain (Pf7, g7, h7) and Black can attack Pc2, Pc3 & Pd4; but both will also be keeping their eyes on the opponent's king, hoping to ensnare him in an attack. }
6...Ne7 ( 6...Nc6 7. Qg4 
{ might be awkward for Black because he doesn't want to play ...g7-g6 and ...Ke8-f8 leaves Rh8 stuck in the corner }
 ) 7. Qg4 O-O
{ For a time this was considered bad, but has recently made a come-back. The king seems a little out of place (unlike after ...O-O-O) , but with ...f7-f5 he's been able to slow White's attacks. }
 ( 
{ Previously and still a favorite is }
 7...Qc7 
{ offering Pg7 (the Poison Pawn Variation ) in exchange for time to attack Pd4 & Pc3 and possibly even Ke1 }
 8. Qxg7 Rg8 9. Qxh7 cxd4 10. Ne2 Nbc6 11. f4 dxc3 12. Qd3 ) 8. Bd3 ( 8. dxc5 
{ in preparation for Bf1-d3 should also be considered }
 ) 8...f5 ( 8...c4 
{ chases Bd3 off this ideal diagonal, but also leaves Pc3 & Pc2 less vulnerable. Whether this is good depends upon how safe Kg8 is from other attack plans and whether Black can generate any serious offense on the queen-side without pressure on Pd4 }
 ) 9. exf6 Rxf6
{ Black hasn't blocked-out Bd3, but has more room for his pieces to defend Kg8. The backward Pe6 is hardly of importance when a king's safety is at stake. There is even the possibility of ...e6-e5 (discovering an attack on Qg4) and then ...e5-e4 to block out Bd3. }
10. Bg5 Rf7 11. Qh5
{ threatening Qh5xh7+ or Bd3xh7+ }
11...g6
{ this secures Ph7 and may serve to provide a support for ...Ne7-f5 }
12. Qd1
{ Although he could have played 12. Qh4 I think he might have had it in mind to play h2-h4-h5xg6 to continue the attack on Kg8. In any event after Qd8 moves Black would have ...Ne7-f5, so Qd1 is safer. }
 ( 12. Qe2 $4 c4 
{ traps Bd3 }
 ) 12...Nbc6 13. Nf3
{ It seems to me this is the moment for Black to define (and begin) his middle-game plan. To develop Bc8-d7 isn't much: ideally Black could now (without White's Pe5) aim for ...e6-e5 when Bc8 could develop to g4 or f5. So, 13...c4 14. Be2 Qd6 might be a good start. If one doesn't like ...c5-c4 then 13...Qd6 could still be played. White can't fight for square e5 so easily. }
13...Qf8 $6 ( 13...Qd6 ) ( 13...c4 14. Be2 Qd6 ) 14. O-O c4 15. Be2 h6

17...g5 ( 17...e5 $5 18. dxe5 Nxe5 19. Qd4 N5c6 20. Qh4 ) 18. g3
{ While Black is moving the pawns in front of his king White aims to control f4, leaving Black's center and king weak. Those two factors (if achieved by White) could lead to a won position. }
18...Nf5 19. Ng2 Qg7 20. f4 Nd6 21. Qe1 b5
{ White might have found it useful to play a3-a4, but Black uses Pb5 to bind Pa3 & Pc3 which blocks Bc1 and Ra1. This isn't essential to a resolution of the pressures on Pf4, but it could contribute to the pressure on Ponomariov to find his way. }
22. fxg5
{ Ponomariov prefers to simplify the position; rightly so I think. His pieces need room to fight, before Black gets in ...e6-e5. }

 ( 27. Qe2 
{ prevents ...g5-g4 and clears the way for Ra1 }
 ) 27...Rf5 $6
{ Since Black can't play ...e6-e5 this rook move doesn't help much. Better is to stir up trouble all across the board by breaking through White's "strong" dark squares with ...b5-b4. }

{ Now it's White who controls b5! An invasion by the White rook could help win the game. One curious thing about this move is that, despite it being White who is forcing matters, Black can benefit to some extent by capturing the gambit pawn and advancing it. }

{ It's not so easy to see, but this backfires on Black. Had it worked to achieve a victory or draw then we might have to reconsider the notation ("?!") . Black is trying to achieve, despite unorthodox means, the primary offensive plan -- to bash White's queen-side and, since White's king remains safe, to advance a pawn to promotion. Considering the alternatives this seems a reasonable try; and by doing so he distracts White, to some extent, from his king-side plans. }

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6
{ It could be argued the ideal pawn formation for Black is with ...d7-d6 and ...g7-g6 as in a Dragon or with ...e7-e6 and ...b7-b6 as in a Queen's Indian Defense. Both and everything else between are played. I've played the Najdorf and Scheveningen variations, but can easily see the advantages of the Dragon too. I haven't been too fond of 2...e6 because there's no added control of square e5, but that doesn't mean Black can't play ...Ng8-f6. 2...e6 serves a similar purpose to 1...e6 in a French Defense. It limits the scope of Bf1 and frees the way for Bf8 to develop. }
 ( 2...d6 ) 3. d4 ( 3. c3 d5 ) 3...cxd4
{ In this Sicilian Variation Black grabs the d-pawn before it can ever serve to support e4-e5. Now, usually, White must use f2-f4 to support the e4-e5 advance. But, that isn't the only plan White can utilize. Instead White aims for general piece activity and freedom of movement to hit Black wherever he can. }

{ is also played }
 ) 5...Qc7 6. Be2 a6
{ Black's pawns limit White's knights and Be2. Black seeks to keep open options while discouraging White from any active operations. }
7. O-O Nf6
{ This normal developing move creates an interesting threat: ...Bf8-b4xc3 and ...Nf6xe4. White tends to disregard this as a threat, to some extent, because the weakening of Black's dark squares is compensation for doubled c-file pawns. However, the loss of Pe4 requires more compensation. }
8. Be3 ( 8. Bg5 Bb4 9. Bxf6 gxf6 
{ and Black might use the g-file to threaten Kg1 }

{ This is a most unusual variation, not often played, but popular for a time in the 1980s. It was "discussed" several times in the Polugaevsky Memorial/Sicilian Love tournament, Buenos Aires 1994. White exploits the weak dark squares in exchange for Pe4. It might seem impossible, at this early stage, for this to be sufficient compensation for a pawn, but it has shown to be effective. }

{ Since White hasn't yet "declared" where Pd2 will be advanced it's not yet clear whether Bf1 will move to g2 (to complement Pc4) or, after d2-d4, go to d3 where it might threaten Black's king-side. Black's next is an ordinary good development move which happens to impede d2-d4 and might be used later ( by ...e5-e4) to fight White's light square bishop. Naturally Black has various plans at his disposal. This is just one. White won't get much of a clue about Black's intentions, so he has to decide what kind of position he wants and go for it. }

1. e4 Nf6
{ Wow! This is interesting. None of the top GMs plays anything this provocative. It is, of course, played by many people at all levels of chess, except at the top. Why does Ivanchuk choose it for this game? One possibility is that he saw Vallejo Pons playing rather solid positions and "offered" a possibility of something more unbalanced and tactical. }
2. Nc3
{ And already White flinches from the main contest (2. e5) . With this I suspect both players are on their own (out of book) . With Nc3 White isn't able to support a d2-d4 with c2-c3, so f2-f4 is more likely. In that case the game could resemble a King's Gambit more than an Italian or Spanish Game. }
2...e5 ( 2...d5 
{ is a more typical Alekhine's Defense response; continuing to force Pe4 to move or be removed. }
 ) 3. Nf3
{ After Black's first-move provocation Vallejo Pons is proceeding very cautiously, perhaps even more than he might normally. Can Ivanchuk play aggressively to exploit that over-caution? How would he go about it? Oftentimes when one player doesn't use pawns much the other can overwhelm him with pawns. But, it depends upon the opening. Too much use of pawns in some openings just leads to difficulties. }
 ( 3. f4 ) 3...Nc6 4. g3
{ After this it's quite possible Black will aim for ...Bh3 to trade-off Bg2, thereby weakening all the light squares on the king-side. Opening the center with ...d7-d5 would be unwise because it opens the diagonal for Bg2, making it stronger. }
 ( 4. Bb5 ) ( 4. d4 ) 4...Bc5 5. Bg2 d6 6. d3
{ By defending Pe4 White is now free to play Nc3-a4xc5. This would get rid of the bishop, but at the cost of opening the d-file for Black. Still it might be good. }
6...a6
{ Ivanchuk clearly wants to keep Bc5 to keep control of d4 and perhaps to have a piece which reaches all the way to f2 (or g1) to threaten White's king. This extra pawn move seems justified. }
7. h3
{ White clearly has an idea of how to coordinate his king-side, to avoid damage. But, such a passive position might still allow Black chances. }
7...O-O $6
{ The king-side seems the natural place for active play (for both White or Black) , so removing the king to the queen-side, where it's adequately defended by Bc5 and Nc6, should be safer and enables freer offensive actions on the king-side. }

1. Nf3
{ Ivanchuk is an enigma. He's capable of some horrificly complicated tactical melees and of some brilliancies, but he's also capable of exceedingly odd play. He usually begins with 1. e4, but will play whatever suits his needs. Here he plays 1. Nf3, it's first occurrence of the tournament, and what kind of game does he desire? Who knows, perhaps not even him. }
1...c5
{ Kasparov offers a transposition to a Sicilian Defense by 2. e4. But, Kasparov can also play many kinds of openings, so this might remain a closed position. }
2. g3
{ With Pc5 White won't get d2-d4 without having to consider ...cxd4. But, it could become an English Opening with c2-c4 or a King's Indian Attack with d2-d3 and e2-e4. }
2...g6 ( 2...Nc6 ) 3. Bg2 Bg7 4. O-O
{ White waits to see how Black is organized before committing any pawns. But, does that gives Black time to make any White pawn move a bad one? With ...Nb8-c6 he makes d2-d4 impossible and c2-c4 weakens d4. }
4...Nc6 5. c3
{ This isn't so terrific. It's an indication Ivanchuk doesn't want to play a King's Indian Attack (5. d3) , but wants to fight Kasparov's pieces head-on. However, in this opening you can't always force such things without dire consequences. Nb1 won't be able to develop to c3 and Black is probably already equal. }
 ( 5. d3 ) ( 5. c4 ) 5...d5 6. d4 cxd4
{ In many of Kasparov's games an exposed Pc4, or in this case Pc5, has given him problems. His choice to exchange-off that pawn probably didn't take him long. It gives the c3 square back to White, so Nb1-c3 will be available. But, Black's Ng8 isn't required to develop to f6 to block Bg7 (as Nf3 does to Bg2) . It can develop Ng8-h6-f5 or with ...e7-e6, Ng8-e7 and Black's position will be very harmonious. }
7. cxd4 e6 8. Nc3 Nge7 9. b3 O-O 10. Qd2
{ Before Bc1-b2 or Bc1-a3 he takes the c1-h6 diagonal to prevent ...Bg7-h6. This preserves control of c1 without having to also play e2-e3. }
10...b6 11. Ba3 Ba6 12. Rac1 Qd7 13. Rfd1 Rfd8
{ This breaks the pin on Ne7 and also prepares to meet e2-e4 with pressure on Pd4. }
14. g4 Rac8 15. h3
{ Both sides have developed sensibly, but now what? Bg2 isn't especially terrific, so White might think of e2-e4, but Black has aligned against Pd4 to prevent that. So, if the central files are to remain closed it would be natural to double rooks on the c-file. }
15...h6
{ Why so passive? }
 ( 15...Rc7 
{ intending either ...Ne7-c8-d6-e4 or ...Rd8-c8 }
 ) 16. e3
{ If Bg2 can't be useful on the h1-a8 diagonal then perhaps he'll just trade it at f1. }
16...Kh7 17. Rc2 $1 Ng8
{ He seems terribly concerned White will get to play e3-e4 in an advantageous way; so it appears he will also play ...Ng8-f6 to control square e4. This goes against his opening development, so one could also expect he will have to pay some cost for this. }
18. Rdc1 Qe8
{ This move is a bit hard to decipher. He might be intending ...f7-f5 to expand on the king-side, while threatening to open the f-file for a Black rook. But, on the c-file it looks like White might be able to force an opening and trade rooks. }
19. Ne1 ( 19. Bf1 $6 Bxf1 20. Kxf1 f5 
{ and the weakness of White's king-side light squares becomes obvious }
 ) 19...Nf6 20. f4
{ Ivanchuk beats Kasparov to the punch and makes his own king-side gesture. Of course there's no way to know, just yet, whether this could succeed or backfire. If the c-file opens and rooks are traded it might not mean anything. If many pieces stay on the board it could lead to a file opening on the king-side and a wild fight all over the board. }
20...Kg8 21. Nd3 ( 
{ leading to terrible confusion is }
 21. g5 hxg5 22. fxg5 Nh7 23. h4 f6 24. Nf3 fxg5 25. hxg5 e5 ) 21...Bxd3
{ With 17...Ng8 Kasparov seemed to be just maneuvering, but here he seems to be saying knights are much better than bishops in this kind of position (with this many pawns and few or no good open diagonals for a bishop) . Certainly e5 would be an excellent outpost square for a knight, so Nd3 had to be removed. On the other hand, White has good control of e4, so ...Nf6-e4 isn't going to be possible. }
22. Qxd3 Bf8 23. Bxf8 Qxf8 24. Qd2 ( 24. f5 Nb4 ) 24...Nb4 25. Rb2 Kg7 26. a3 Nc6 27. b4
{ If Ivanchuk is in the mood to move pawns he might eventually over-extend and leave his backdoor open. At the moment everything seems under control; Pa3 & Pb4 do well to block the diagonal and Qf8. }
27...Ne7 28. Rbc2 Ne8
{ Kasparov does some remaneuvering (again) and has his eye on c4. }
29. Bf1 ( 29. Nb5 
{ while Qf8 is somewhat away from the queen-side }
 29...Rxc2 30. Rxc2 Rd7 31. Qc1 a6 32. Nc3 Nd6 33. Na4 Qb8 ) 29...Nd6 30. Ba6
{ keeps excellent control of the c-file and attempts to keep Black's pieces from defending one another }
30...Rc6 31. Qd3
{ If he can't prevent Kasparov from ...Nd6-c4, then at least he can make Nc4 a bad exposed piece. Here he prepares to defend Pe3 & Pa3 and to play e3-e4 or a3-a4 to advance around a Nc4, while it is made into a target. }
31...h5
{ As in his game with Villejo Pons, Kasparov sees an opportunity to open a second front, aimed at Kg1. This is partly a matter of necessity since Ivanchuk controls the queen-side very well, and it's partly opportunism to take advantage of the weakened light squares Bg2 previously guarded. }
32. Qe2 ( 32. gxh5 
{ should be quite good because Rc2 can move across to the king-side before any Black rook could, and removing pawns from in front of Kg7 should be good. The only downside is giving control of f5 to Black. }
 ) 32...Qh8 33. Kg2 Qh7
{ What a horrible place for the queen. If White could simply lock up the king-side with g4-g5 and then force a quick opening of the c-file he might invade on the queen-side to win. But, Pe3 is weak and ...Ne7-f5xe3 is a serious threat. It's tempting. }
34. g5
{ That puts an end to the second front. It gives up square f5, but that's of little concern compared to keeping Kg2 safe. This was an amazingly indirect maneuvering game. I haven't seen these two play this kind of game before. I suppose it shows they each have great respect for the other's tactical prowess. If anyone it was Ivanchuk, in the final position, who has the advantage! }

{ In earlier rounds he has played 1. c4 against Kasparov (barely surviving) and 1. e4 against Ivanchuk (preferring a closed line with 2. Nc3 and g2-g3, Bf1-g2) . Apparently he believes it will be difficult for his opponents to come and get him if he maintains a safe position. }
1...e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. g3
{ a big improvement over 4. e4 Bb4 from his first round game versus Kasparov }

{ Black refuses to allow White to control d5, holding back Black's pieces in the center. }
5. cxd5 Nxd5 6. Bg2 Nb6
{ This kind of Reversed Sicilian Dragon, Classical Variation isn't too bad for Black. Black has played ...Nd5-b6 to avoid tactical difficulties. White threatened Nf3xe5 when Bg2 and Nc3 double attack Nd5. He'd also rather retreat than capture Nc3. Allowing White to open the b-file with 6...Nxc3? 7. bxc3 isn't very good for Black. Usually White (and possibly Black) has to play on the wing (White with a2-a3, b2-b4-b5 and Black with ...Bf8-e7, ...g7-g5-g4) to fight for central squares. }
7. O-O Be7 ( 7...g5

{ and ...g5-g4 doesn't chase Nf3 backward since it can capture Pd4 }
 ) ( 7...Be6 ) 8. a3
{ White realizes Black might play ...g7-g5-g4, so he begins his own threat of b2-b4-b5 to counter it. They're fighting over control of e5 and d4. }
8...O-O
{ White's quick queen-side threat (b2-b4-b5) prevented Black from getting to play his own ...g7-g5-g4, so Black simply castles and continues normally. }

 ) 9. b4 Be6 10. Rb1 f6 11. d3 ( 11. b5 Nd4 ) 11...Nd4
{ This is a surprising move. Usually Black would avoid a trade of Nf3 in order to keep Bg2 under cover. But, in this case it appears Black intends to get his queen-side better organized before White could play Bc1-e3 and Nc3-e4-c5. }

{ Bg2 is blocked out of play for quite some time. }
 ( 17. d4 ) 17...Bf7 18. d4
{ This seems to solve White's problems. The threat of d4-d5 to block Bf7 or the threat of d4xe5 should force Black to exchange pawns and that opens up the way for Bb2. Pe4 will still be blocking Bg2, but if square e5 opens then there's still a chance for e4-e5 to free that bishop too. }

{ White is pretty well organized to avoid incursions except at c4. Moving Qe2-d3 allows Bf3-e2, securing c4. }
28...Qc4
{ So, Black doesn't waste time. }
 29. Be2 Bg6 
{ White can't support Pe4 with f2-f3 because it's pinned and he won't want to move Nb3-d2 because that would allow ...Qc4-c1+, with further damage to follow. }

{ Finally, after that phase the position opens a bit and it appears Black's pieces are a little better. Pe5 blunts Ba1 and Na4 & Bb6 restrain Nb3. So, Be4 and Bc4 duel. It appears to me Pd5 is exposed and weak, so ...Kg8-f8-e7-d6 would be an obvious continuation for Black. }
32. Nd2 Bf5
{ Even after this there's a threat of ...Kg8-d6 and ...Bf5-g6-f7xd5. }
33. d6+ Kf8 34. Bd5
{ This is a very nifty tactic as it attacks two Black pawns (Pb7 & Pa6) and opens the way for Nd2-c4. Black wasn't given any time to establish a bind by blockading Pd5 and now he even has to spend moves on defense. }
34...Bc8 35. d7 ( 35. Nc4 $2 Ke8 
{ and Pd6 isn't a weapon any more! }
 ) 35...Bxd7 36. Bxb7 Bb5
{ Time to re-evaluate: Pa6 is defended, but White has a two-to-one queen-side pawn majority. Fortunately for Black the pawns are blockaded and his king has approached the center, so that shouldn't be dangerous. White has a problem bishop (Ba1) , but even that may evaporate if White gets f2-f4 or Nd2-e4-c3. It's about as equal as can be. }
37. Be4 ( 37. Ne4 ) 37...h6 38. Bc2 Ke7 39. Kg2
{ After this it is clearer that Black's king can't approach Pa3 because Bc2-b3, in particular, will chase him away. Nd2 helps secure square c4, so Black can't use Bb5 to worm his way in by opposing Bc2. }

1. e4 e6
{ Anand has played the French Defense a few times, though it doesn't really seem ideal for his style. His 3rd round game with Kasparov was a Sicilian, but one where he was hunkered down and counter-attacking. Perhaps that's just his mood for this game too. The French Defense is one of the ideal defenses for that attitude (Alekhine's Def. and the Pirc/Modern/Gurgenidze Def. being others) . }
2. d4 d5 3. Nd2 dxe4
{ This indicates a desire for a simple game with many exchanges, leading to a draw. Various methods have been created for White, but none has been a sure-fire way of generating an advantage; the position is too open and with no serious weaknesses, except the difficulty Black has developing Bc8. }

2. Nf3 Nf6 3. c4 ( 3. Bf4 
{ I suppose one ideal set-up would have both c2-c4 and Bc1-f4, so that White could utilize the open c-file and try to invade at c7. }
 ) 3...dxc4
{ To transpose to a Queen's Gambit Accepted at this point has it's interesting points. For one White can't continue with an immediate e2-e4. Black also doesn't have to worry about the double attack which would result from the move-sequence 1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. e3 a6 4. Bxc4 b5?? 5. Qf3 because there's a Nf3. }
4. Qa4+
{ Ivanchuk avoids complications stemming from 4. Nc3 a6 and just regains the pawn. He's also left Nb1, so as to not get in the way of his queen. If there's a Nc3 and Qc4 (after regaining the pawn) it can be awkward. }
 ( 4. Nc3 a6 ) 4...Nc6
{ Ponomariov is aiming for completely free and easy development with no pawn weaknesses. There is a similar variation in the Catalan opening, but in that one White gets in Nf3-e5xc6 to force tripled pawns on Black. Here White will have to develop solidly and yet threaten to meet such moves as ...e7-e5 with d4-d5 to cramp Black. The battle is on! }

16. a3 Bxc3 17. Bxc3 Nxc3 18. bxc3 Rd5
{ Ponomariov's strategy for this game seems to be eXtreme piece activity with very few pawn moves, giving Ivanchuk no time to use his pawns or to build up any kind of pressure. At the first sign of that sort of thing Ponomariov has gone for exchanges. }
19. f4 Rc5 20. Rc1
{ Ivanchuk could continue, despite this not being his kind of position, but it would be difficult to achieve anything, even if White gave back the pawn. Black's piece activity and immediate threats to Pa3 & Pc3 makes it difficult for White to make even one free offensive move. These two creep forward and are tied with Anand for 2nd-4th, now one full point behind Kasparov (who beat Vallejo Pons this round) . }

1. e4 c5
{ I suppose it's ironic that Vallejo Pons should NOT play the Black side of a Spanish, Berlin Variation against Kasparov. Of all his opponents this one, who had such difficulty against that opening variation in his match with Kramnik, is the one he trusts will have something prepared, an improvement which might beat him. }
2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 a6
{ Paulsen's idea was to delay committing pieces before limiting White's Nd4 and Bf1 and seeing how White develops his others. He would sometimes play ...d7-d6, Nb8-d7 and sometimes ...Qd8-c7 with ...Nb8-c6. More recently GM Taimanov of Russia has employed this kind of opening flexibility. The 4...a6 line carries Paulsen's name and 4...Nc6 carries Taimanov's name. }
5. c4
{ Though this is an acceptable move I'm surprised to see Kasparov use it. He's hard to predict. Sometimes it's clear he has an idea he wants to try, other times he just seems to be preventing his opponent from playing from his home preparations. This kind of improvisation can stymie the opponent or backfire. Which will it be this time? }
 ( 5. Bd3 ) 5...Nf6 6. Nc3 Qc7 $2
{ There are good normal-looking development moves and there are plausible normal-looking, but bad moves. This move seems aimed at developing ...Nb8-c6 without an exchange forcing him to recapture with a pawn at c6. But, that completely disregards White's bold c2-c4 and the clamp on d5. Moving Qd8 off the file makes ...d7-d5 impossible. Not pinning Nc3 leaves Pe4 completely safe. I'd say it's usually not so terrific to play a Hedgehog formation, but against Kasparov it has to be bad; but that's what Black has to do now. }
 ( 6...Bb4 
{ challenged for control of e4 and d5. Black might follow-up with ...Nb8-c6 and ...d7-d5. }
 ) 7. a3 $5
{ Kasparov emphasizes his bind on the center and leaves Black to find some other way to break it open. The bad side of this move isn't so obvious, but with experience in Maroczy Bind positions (such as this) the pawns are better at a2 & b2 or a2 & b3. Once there's a pawn at a3 the queen-side is weaker and Black will threaten Pc4 as much as he can. If then b2-b3 defends Pa3 will be weaker. }

8...Bb7
{ With this it looks like Black is ready for ...d7-d5. }

 ( 9...d5 10. cxd5 exd5 11. Nxd5 Nxd5 12. exd5 Bxd5 13. Rc1 $14 ) 10. Be2 Rb8 11. b4
{ Though he's making a lot of pawn moves which Black should be able to counteract, he's playing to the idea which Black seems to be happy with, that there should be no quick break-out and Black should wait for a mistake or to find some weakness to counter-attack. But, Kasparov isn't going to give him anything once he gets developed; Black should fight back quicker, before White gets all his pieces active. }

15...Ba8 16. Qe2
{ I'm not sure why he doesn't commit to the direct e4-e5, but this move allows Rf1 to defend Rc1 and it takes aim at Pa6 as well as getting behind Pe4. }

So, Ivanchuk climbs toward the top, now tied with Ponomariov and Anand, only one-half point behind Kasparov (though Ponomariov has already had his odd-man-out day off) . }

{ I don't know how much fighting spirit is left in these two. They've both had their ups and downs and probably feel there's little chance to climb back into the fight for first place. Adams has played five decisive games, so there's no doubt any of his games might follow suit. }

{ The bishop may take an odd route (Bf8-d6-b8-a7) to find a weak White pawn it can target. This is the kind of contortions one has to endure when the opening play hasn't secured adequate space for the pieces. I suppose I should add, though it's guesswork, that Shirov may have played this way to provoke Adams into rash pawn moves which might weaken his position so that Shirov could counter-attack successfully. It's an odd thought though. Adams isn't known for doing anything rashly or out of control. }

{ From here the knight defends Pa6 and keeps Ra4 inactive. After an e4-e5 it could go back ...Nb4-d5. However, it's tied to Bd6, so e4-e5 would shove ...Bd6-e7 which isn't a very active square for the bishop. }
16. Bd2
{ White immediately challenges this "bone in his throat". Adams is the kind of player who will emphasize coordination and mobility for his pieces. It's a little unusual for an 1. e4 player, but, it doesn't take much effort to recall how effective GM Anatoly Karpov was with 1. e4. }

{ This creates a kind of wall on the e-file. Black's queen-side pieces will find it difficult to cross that wall to help defend Kg8. White might use Ra1-a3, Bc3-d4, Ra3-g3 to bring at least one more big piece to the king-side. There is also Bc3-d2-h6, but Pe5 needs defense. }

{ Black might be preparing ...f7-f6 since Qf4 isn't defended, but any move (s) such as that would end up opening lines to Kh8. }

{ probably hoping for ...Bb5-e2xh5-g6 }
28. Rc3 Nc6 29. Bc5 Be2 30. Rd2 Bxh5 31. Rh3
{ This is most direct to the point. He could have played Bc5-d6, but that isn't really necessary. Only if counter-play via the capture of e5 was going to be effective would White take the time to prevent it. In the final position Black can't do much. If 31...Bh5-g6 Rxh6+ forces mate and 31...g5 allows 32. Qf6+ and 33. Rxh5, winning the piece and/or checkmating. This has got to be one of the strangest tournaments for Adams.

{ As in the game with Kasparov Black's position is relatively weakness-free. But, the most likely place for White to attack is at g7 or h7 and that places Black's king in danger. White, on the other hand, has no major weakness of a similar quality (Pc4, for example) . }

12. Bd2
{ This is a tepid move, but he is gradually mobilizing his pieces while keeping an eye on Black's formation and where he will need to focus his attention. Right now it looks like e4-e5 or f4-f5, but there's also a possibility of moving heavy pieces onto the h-file. }
12...Bf8 13. Rad1
{ Mysterious? No, he expects ...Bf8-g7, so Pd6 would be the big weakness. Of course this will leave Black wondering what to do with Bf8. }
13...Nh5
{ In his 9th round game (Vallejo Pons - Anand) he had to meet an f-file attack against his castled king and Nf3-h4 was played to gain space for f2-f4. Is he replaying that game or does he have some original idea here? }
14. Nf3
{ Ivanchuk doesn't appear to be in a hurry, but he's not going to allow ...Qd8-h4 either. He's incidentally (?) clearing the d-file and may plan Bd2-e3-d4. This is an amazingly quiet maneuvering noncomittal game for Ivanchuk. }
14...b6 15. e5
{ Now the flood gates open and Black has Nd7 and Nh5 and Re8 developed. Most of his pieces are passively on the back rank. That's not to say this will be a crush, but White clearly has an advantage. }
15...Bb7 16. Ng5
{ Now Pd6, Pf7 and Ph7 are all threatened. It's no coincidence. }
16...Ng7 17. Be4
{ Since the bishop is blocked by Pg6 he decides to trade it for Bb7, so he might use square e4 for another piece. This move also continues to clear the d-file. }

{ The bad news is that the attack doesn't end. The f-file is open and Ne4 has good control of f6 and the h-file is open, so Kg8 still isn't safe after a queen trade. I suppose his worst frustration is that he's given a pawn and hoped to keep some material edge as compensation for his positional woes, but now he's just behind material and position. One of the things I liked most about this game is that Ivanchuk didn't force much. He let Vallejo Pons strangle on his own inability to develop and maneuver properly. Ivanchuk just kept flexible and attacked when he had specific targets and all his pieces involved. Chess looks so easy sometimes. }

{ It's rather amazing to me that this opening variation should continue to be the primary defense of many top GMs. It was invented in the 1950s by Najdorf (originally of Poland, but after World War II of Argentina) and fought over throughout the 1960s and 70s. Bobby Fischer utilized it and honed it like a knife. Many years later, after other defenses have been tried and many discarded, this is Kasparov's favorite. It's interesting also to note that there are a zillion 6th moves White can choose from, and the one played most these days by the top GMs is 6. Be3, a move (and system) created by GM Robert Byrne, a New Yorker who was a childhood (and perhaps lifelong) friend of Bobby Fischer. Did he invent this opening variation to combat Fischer? I don't know. It was taken up by Englishmen and made more popular in the 1980s and 90s. Now it's commonplace. }
6. Be3
{ Fischer preferred 6. Bc4 and that's still considered good, but it's not to the taste of today's players. I suppose I should also add that 6. Bg5 was "all the rage" during the 1960s and 70s when Fischer played actively, but his "Poison Pawn Variation" (after 6. Bg5 e6 7. f4 Qb6 8. Qd2 Qxb2) is still considered good, and it's one reason 6. Bg5 isn't played much now. }

{ Particularly against 6. Be2 this move (6...e5) was Fischer's response. It is named for Opocensky, but like many variations, Fischer played it a lot and made it popular. It makes sense that as White he'd play 6. Bc4 if he thought Black might play 6...e5, leaving the c4-f7 diagonal open. }
7. Nb3
{ Now there are a couple of weaknesses in Black's pawn structure, so White will have a clear idea of where to play (d5, d6, b6) . However, Pe5 controls d4 and with ...Bc8-e6 Black controls d5 pretty well too. Only Bf8 will be noticably bad. }
7...Be6 8. f3

1. Nf3
{ He varies from 1. c4, perhaps because he thinks his opponents are now focusing on him and finding particular plans to defeat him, rather than taking him for granted. He might just be tired (for the moment) of his usual opening. }
1...Nf6 2. c4
{ His move-order has prevented the 1. c4 e5 defense for Black. Now if Black wants ...e7-e5 he'll have to provide it's support first. This is one reason some people meet 1. Nf3 with 1...d5. It takes the game out of the realm of the English Opening (generally) . There are others who don't depend so fully on ...e5, so they might consider a King's Indian Defense set-up (generally aiming for ...e7-e5 after some development moves) or a symmetrical ...c7-c5. }
2...e6
{ This move continues to hide Black's intentions, to a certain extent. Often it's played like a Nimzo-Indian Defense, so that 3. Nc3 Bb4 helps Black fight for control of d5 and e4. To achieve the same end he might continue with the direct and classical ...d7-d5 or with a more modern Queen's Indian Defense (...b7-b6, ...Bc8-b7) . There are also other approaches: something completely different like ...c7-c5, delaying the development of Bc8 until he has ...Nb8-c6. To add to the confusion there is also a possibility of a Benoni Defense (3. d4 c5 4. d5 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 6. Nc3 g6) when Black fianchettoes the dark-square bishop after all. It's potentially quite confusing. }
3. Nc3 c5
{ Black has had good success with this, with GM Nick DeFirmian as one of it's best proponents. It aims to play an open position after d2-d4 cxd4 very actively before White can develop and remove his king from the center. White should move with some caution. }
4. g3 b6
{ Black chooses a kind of Queen's Indian Defense formation with an early ...c7-c5. By attempting to nullify White's Bg2 early-on Black should do alright. He's also kept Pd7 to keep Ke8 safe and to guard c6. Keeping those pawns (Pd7, Pe6, Pf7) on light squares can be very useful if Bc8 is traded off. If there is no early trade we might see those pawns move to other squares (...d7-d5 for example) . }
5. Bg2 Bb7 6. O-O Be7 7. Re1
{ GM Walter Browne utilized this plan against GM Alexander Ivanov several years ago in the United States championship. It was copied by many people soon after and usually with good results. Black hadn't planned (perhaps) on having to deal with another White pawn advancing in the center so quickly. White threatens e2-e4-e5 when Nf6 isn't well prepared to move. }
7...Ne4
{ This is a nice response. Just get rid of the knight. White can't utilize the diagonal because ...Ne4xc3 hits White's queen. So, White would have to move Nc3 to avoid the trade and then try to exploit the exposed Ne4. }
8. Nxe4
{ This continues the plan with no loss of time, but also without as much impact. }
 ( 8. Nb1 O-O 9. d3 Ng5

 11...h6 
{ and White hasn't made significant progress! }
 ) 8...Bxe4 9. d3 Bb7 10. e4
{ Vallejo Pons used the Pc4 & Pe4 formation in his game against Kasparov, so this isn't unfamiliar to him. Those pawns block both Bg2 and Bb7, so let's look at other factors to decide who is better or has a better continuation. With e4-e5 it's hard to see Black getting a grip on the dark squares with ...Nb8-c6, ...d7-d5, ...Be7-f6, but Black could challenge Pe4 more directly with ...d7-d5 or ...O-O and ...f7-f5. White will have to concede to pawn exchanges (else his central pawn structure would become broken) or to moving Nf3, so he can advance f2-f4. I'd favor Black, but that's just personal taste. }
10...O-O 11. d4
{ This is an interesting change of tack. White opens things up, but he doesn't have the best grip on d5 since Nc3 is gone. Maybe now Black can play on the dark squares a little more actively. }
11...cxd4 12. Nxd4 d6 13. b3

{ It appears Adams decided he might need that bishop for later duty, perhaps defending Pd6, and so he gives it a retreat square. Nc5 can only be captured if White is willing to lose Nd4 in return; the d-file would open and Nd4 would be pinned to Qd2. }
 ( 20...Bxd4 $5 ) 21. Nc2 Nd7 22. g5 Bg7 23. Ne3
{ I wonder if after Ne3 Adams regretted not capturing it on move 20. Now the knight controls d5, to keep the central bind, and it might hop over to g4 to threaten invasion at f6 or h6. Black no longer has ...e6-e5 to fork two pieces and force a favorable line opening. Now ... e6-e5 would be met by f4-f5 to advance a king-side attack. }

{ I don't recall Ivanchuk previously using this system against Kasparov. His flexibility with openings is shared by some other GMs, but few people truly play many defenses (or openings for White) with equal skill.

12. O-O Rb8
{ Usually one wouldn't consider moving Pb7 when there's a Be2 to target Pa6, but Black has to be able to play ...b7-b6 to prevent c4-c5 and possibly to play ...b7-b5 (or ...b6-b5) to chop into White's central pawns, making more room for Black pieces to maneuver.

{ It's this kind of move which seems so mysterious. What does it do, except keep the status quo? One obvious offensive idea is to double rooks on the d-file to threaten Pd6, but that's met by ...g7-g5 to chase Bf4 back. I suppose Kasparov just decided it wasn't worth the risk to try any major offensive thrust; so, he'll just wait for the next game and see what develops. }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. e4
{ This is more aggressive than 3. Nf3, but it also offers Black more choices for defense. Common responses are 3...c5, 3...e5 or 3...Nf6. All of them challenge White's central pawns immediately. There were a couple of these played in the FIDE wch match of Ivanchuk and Ponomariov. If White is allowed time to develop pieces to support his pawns then Black would have real problems. It's essential to know precisely what White's pawn formation is, so that Black's developments will be most effective. If White can keep his pawns as a duo they might advance in any fashion to foil Black's early developments. }
3...Nf6 4. e5 Nd5 5. Bxc4 Nb6 6. Bd3
{ Now Black knows not to fianchetto either bishop. Instead ...Bc8-e6-d5 followed by ...e7-e6, ...c7-c5 and ...Nb8-c6 would be coherent and apply terrific pressure to White's central pawns. Incidentally Pd4 isn't en prise because 6...Qxd4 is met decisively by 7. Bb5+. }

{ has also been tried }
 ) 7...Nb4 8. Be4 f5
{ Black too does some non-classical things: moving knights multiple times and now weakening Ke8 with ...f7-f5. It's often difficult to explain the rationale for such play. In this case Black can't get Bc8 developed as early as he'd like, so he uses Pf5 to control light squares. Black has to stake out control of the light squares to fix White's central pawns in place, then the assault on them would begin. This also explains why Black doesn't move ...Nb4-d5. He needs to leave open the possibility of ...c7-c5xd4, so control of d5 is sufficient; he doesn't have to occupy the square. }
9. exf6 exf6
{ This is a dramatic change of the landscape. White doesn't continue with the central pawns now that he's gained a concession (king's weakness) from Black. Now piece play can become prevalent.

1. e4
{ Theoretically this is Ponomariov's best chance to win and get back into the race for first. But, in practice Vallejo Pons has proven tough to beat. }
1...c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 a6 5. Nc3
{ Finally, someone chooses not to play c2-c4. However, 5. Bd3 is considered better by most people. Nc3 is a waiting target for ...b7-b5 or might be pinned by ...Bf8-b4. Black usually plays strongly on the dark squares, as in many Sicilian Defense variations, with White defending Nd4 & Nc3 and trying to find a way to open lines to Ke8 or make something of the half open d-file. }
5...b5 6. Bd3
{ preparing to meet ...b5-b4 with Nc3-e2 }
6...Bb7
{ Taking aim at Pe4 isn't going to succeed the way it would in many other variations. Here White has taken extra precaution to keep Pe4 safe and left Nd4 a little weaker. Black should adjust his play in recognition of this. }
 ( 6...Qb6 
{ If Black can chase Nd4 back then there would be very little danger to Black; only the possibility of Nc3-d5 would have to be prevented. }
 ) 7. O-O Nc6 $6 8. Nxc6 Bxc6 9. Qe2
{ preparing Nc3-d5. This is a common tactic in a variation where Black hasn't quickly developed Ng8 and Bf8 to enable ...O-O. Ke8 is definately a target! }
9...Ne7
{ This takes care of the immediate threat, but also leaves Black's position awkward. }

{ With Bf8 blocked from action on the queen-side White decides to threaten Pb5. Bd2 prepares a2-a4. }
10...Ng6 11. a4 b4 12. Nd5
{ Now he's combining both tactics (pressure on Pb4 and Nc3-d5) which might have the effect of overwhelming Black. }
12...a5 13. c3 b3 14. g3
{ He's preparing Nd5-e3 and disallowing ...Ng6-f4. It's not terribly pretty, but Nd5 will have to move eventually. }

{ For a position which has arisen from a Sicilian Defense this is very odd. The queen-side pawn formation is quite unusual and White's bishops on the d-file and Pg3 are peculiar. White should try to play on the d-file and perhaps try to win Pb3. He shouldn't allow Black to open the f-file with ...f7-f5. That would make Bc6 too good. So, Bd3-b5 to trade bishops might be useful. But, Pe4 needs defense, so Ne3 must move first. }

24...dxc6 25. Nd4 c5 26. Nb5 Rad8 27. h3 Nh6 28. Rfd1 Qb3 29. Rd6
{ Black has absolutely no offense, but he does have a weak Pe6 and trapped Qb3. White threatens Ra1-a3xb3. This looked as easy as Ivanchuk's victory and is more to be expected than the struggle Kasparov had to endure before gaining the full point against Vallejo Pons. It also puts Ponomariov right back into a tie for first with Kasparov. This sets up the climactic struggle between those two in the next round -- winner take all! }

1. d4 d5 2. Nf3

{ This can be effective to fight Pd5 because Black would be risking a lot to just play ...c7-c6 and hold on. Usually Black captures Pc4 and fights to activate his pieces with the belief White isn't so likely to play or be able to utilize e2-e4 because Bg2 would be blocked. }
5...O-O
{ After this Black is conceivably threatening to take Pc4 and hold onto it. }
6. Qc2 ( 6. b3 ) 6...c5
{ This is an attempt to show White hasn't put enough pressure on the center or developed quickly enough to avoid simplification. I wouldn't say this is a sharp attempt by Black to play for a win, though it is conceivable one would still win with the Black pieces. Pd5 is weaker than before, so cxd5 might loosen up Black's position a bit. }

{ The mix of pieces is unusual and that complicates the task of both players. I wonder who offered the draw. I also find it interesting that Ivanchuk didn't make any headway against Ponomariov's Queen's Gambit Accepted or against Anand with the Catalan, where the basic idea of Black threatening to take and hold onto Pc4 is primary and for Black to play strongly with his pieces while Bg2 is (at least temporarily) blocked by Nf3 seems to give Black easy equality. }

1. e4 c5
{ Playing Adams in this tournament has been something akin to walking through a minefield. If Kasparov can get through unscathed he'll stay in the lead and get to the climactic matchup with Ponomariov in the next game. But, if he should lose he'll be the underdog in that big matchup. Adams or Shirov in the last round, could act as spoilers, but the fight is between Kasparov and Ponomariov. }

 ) ( 5...Nc6 
{ seems to have almost disapeared from top-level tournaments (and matches) , though I don't know precisely why }
 ) 6. Be3 e6 7. Qf3
{ Wow, now this is something interesting. I've seen a New In Chess magazine theoretical article on 6. Qf3 and played 6. Bg5 e6 7. Qf3, but I've never seen it played after 6. Be3. The idea is usually to allow O-O-O without having Qd2 blocking the d-file and to be able to meet ...e6-e5 with Nd4-f5 (and possibly ...g7-g6 with Nf5-e3, so putting Be3 seems odd. It's weakness is that it blocks Pf2 from immediately moving to f4, so that means Black can use square e5 or at least he doesn't have to worry much about e4-e5. }
7...Nbd7 8. Be2
{ preparing g2-g4-g5 }
 ( 8. O-O-O) 8...h5
{ Yes, it prevents g2-g4, but what does Ke8 have to say about it? Does he feel safer now? I think Adams would be happy to have another weakness he can play against, without having extended his own position; just so he doesn't lose Qf3 because of it's exposure. }
9. Bg5 Qa5

{ It would appear Black wants to play ...Nd7-e5-c4 or ...b7-b5 and ...Bc8-b7. }
12. a4
{ This move is slightly effective. It prevents ...b7-b5, so that after ...b7-b6 Pa6 will still need a defender. It also indicates White won't be castling to the queen-side and if he goes king-side one has to ask, "Is Qf3 well placed?" }
 ( 12. Qh3 b5 13. a3 Bb7 14. Bd3 ) 12...b6 13. Bg5
{ In many instances this freezes Nd7 as defender of Nf6. But, Black could spend a tempo on ...Bf8-e7 to take over that duty. }
13...Bb7 14. Rd1 Be7 15. Qe3
{ Adams is slowly rearranging his pieces to suit his needs in regard to playing against the slightly odd Black position. He might yet O-O and play f2-f4, but he is wisely repositioning his queen to prevent ...Nd7-c5 from being effective. Of course, that doesn't prevent ...Nd7-e5-c4. }
15...Nc5 $5 16. Nd2 $6

{ Kasparov was fully prepared to have his Ng4 captured. With or without that he was hitting Ph2, so that ...d6-d5 could clear the way for ...Qc7xh2#. He wasn't going to ...O-O anyway, so this just gives Rh8 a way to play. That Black gains the two bishops is probably incidental, but may prove useful later. }
19. Bxe7 d5 20. Qg3 Qxg3 21. fxg3 Kxe7
{ And this is the result. Pe4 is en prise and Ph2 is very weak; if Black were to double rooks on the h-file it would probably fall. The open f-file isn't so bad for Black. He could play ...f7-f6 in a pinch, but Pg4 is quite weak. One Black advantage which could easily be overlooked is that his king is centralized and would be better in an endgame (I think the current situation is too complicated to be called an endgame and neither king would feel safe playing offensively) . }
22. exd5 $1

This relentless attack wasn't so flashy as many, but it was very accurate and showed the pawns can't leave a king exposed without major consequences. In this case the defense was good, but the position was (apparently) irreparable. That the White pieces won this and the Adams-Anand games using this same (new to my knowledge) opening idea is notable. Anand didn't lose because of it, he misplayed a queen and pawn ending, but Ponomariov never quite recovered from the positional weaknesses around his king, created during the opening and early middle-game. Kasparov takes the lead in the tournament with only one round to go! }

{ I'm surprised to see this move. I'd been thinking about it and then saw a game GM Yudasin - IM Nakamura from a recent event and now here it is again. White's idea is to not commit to d2-d4 and to perhaps threaten c2-c3, d2-d4 when he's used Bc4 to prevent the counter ...d6-d5. Black can easily play ...Ng8-f6 or ...Nb8-c6, but he must realize White's possible plan to achieve d2-d4, else he'll have no offensive potential. }

Another is ...e6-e5 which produces a Ruy Lopez kind of structure except Black hasn't weakened his queen-side (or gained space if that's a plan you prefer for Black) .

{ Although Kasparov is one point ahead he might lose his last round game to Shirov, so it's important for Ponomariov to try to win this one. He's the only player who could catch Kasparov. }
1...e5
{ After seeing the Sicilian Defense so many times it's quite a curious thing to see this recent trend (at least amongst the top-level GMs) toward 1. e4 e5 with both the Petrov's Defense and 2. Nf3 Nc6 being played. The so-called hypermodern defenses have been relegated to the back-burner. I haven't seen a Modern/Pirc or Alekhine's Defense game for a long time. And, although the Caro-Kann and French Defenses are still played they're clearly in the minority. }
2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Be7 6. Re1 b5 7. Bb3 O-O
{ Now this is interesting. I don't recall seeing Anand threaten or play the Marshall Gambit. Why on earth has this variation experienced a resurgence in recent years? Of course, it goes through ups and downs as people play it, discover problems, study it and then play it again. Perhaps it's just that other defenses seem to have a few more adherents than this one, so that the ups and downs of some Sicilian Defense or Queen's Gambit variation is hardly noticed. One must remember also, there are many variations of a Spanish and this is but one. }

{ It seems odd to move the rook so many times, but White must use whatever pieces are available to get the job done. It was once thought White should develop Bc1-e3, Qd1-d3, Nb1-d2, Qd3-f1. But, Re1-e4 forces either a retreat or other concession from Black and enables Qd1-f1. }

{ Because of this Black's king shouldn't be quite as safe and that gives White some counter-attacking possibilities. }
16. Qe2 f5
{ In Ponomariov-Adams from round 9 Ponomariov established Re4 as a perimeter and offered for Black to capture it with a minor piece. He also played f2-f3 to support that perimeter. As a result his king was weakened a bit, but Black didn't quite break through and was pushed back. In this game Anand is using a pawn to challenge Re4, so this game ought to have a different appearance and the clash might occur more on Black's terms. }

17...cxd5 18. Re6
{ It's amazing that White isn't developed and he continues to offer this exchange sac AND Black refuses to take it because the pawn pushes have exposed his king -- he needs to keep pieces on the board to keep his king safe, at least from a perpetual check. How can Black get free to continue his offensive if White mucks it up by threatening Bd6 or checks to Kg8? }

Pf3 is a bone in White's throat and continues to give Black chances to win. }

1. e4
{ At this point in the tournament Shirov has drawn with everyone but Adams and has beaten Ivanchuk (3rd-5th place finish) , but lost (with Black) to Anand, Adams and Vallejo Pons (3rd-5th and 6th place finishers) . This is an odd sort of result except that each and every one of these contestants is very strong. One gets the sense Shirov is trying to figure out how to beat the top players and this tournament was (for Shirov) as much for experimentation as anything; or maybe he's just in a bit of a slump. }
1...c5 2. Nf3 Nc6
{ Already this is a surprise. I can't recall the last time Kasparov played this. Here are some of his "surprises" from the tournament: round 1 as Black against Vallejo Pons' English Opening he played 2...e5; round 8 as White against Vallejo Pons' Sicilian Defense he played c2-c4 to establish a Maroczy Bind; round 7 against Shirov's Sicilian Defense he played 3. Bb5 and, now in this Sicilian Defense game against Shirov he has played 2...Nc6. }
3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5
{ I don't recall ever seeing Kasparov play this. And, why would he play such a double-edged opening when all he needs is a draw to win the tournament. He risks a lot with this choice because a loss here and a win by Ponomariov would give Ponomariov a tie for first with Kasparov. }

{ This isn't unknown, but it is uncommon. There aren't so many players who wish to enter into a tactical melee this quickly. The strategic idea is that White's bishop isn't very good and this way it gives it's life to make Na3 very good and to open some lines to Ke8, so it will never find a safe haven. }
